                        I never thought I would ever have to say this, but all of Crypto has become boring as hell. 
                        Yeah, everything is just about attention now. Understood.

                        Are you following a project that has some utility or is in the process of building that? Then likely you and the other members of the community are out there shilling that utility on twitter. Perpetrated by repeating the same old phrases that end with „…to the moon!“ or „…will melt faces!“, showing a chart pattern that hints at a possible pump… you name it. And what else are you even supposed to do? You are not a member of the core dev-team and cannot contribute to building the actual tech and you do not have access to the projects funds to spend them on marketing. So you become a twitter-shill-zombie, calling yourself and your friends „army“. But 500 people repeating the same sentence every day for a year do not add up to a culture! You are just a zombie in an army of braindead, fighting other braindead armies in the endless battle for the title of who bores all the others to death.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Oh, but maybe your project is different. You have a marketing wallet to throw money out to pay for attention. So you pay John from Shit-CEX for a listing or callers and influencers to shill your project for horrendous amounts of ETH, even though everyone with two brain cells who has been in crypto for longer than six months has figured out that those guys are just talking billboards. And why tf are you paying for a press release, when everything you have prepared to release about yourself is just stating your mere existence?

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Even your memecoin does that shit. Memes have all the freedom in the world to be as creative and non-pc as is imaginable, why do you default to the same generic behaviour? Why pay Cointelegraph, an AMA, a banner-ad on random crypto-website to showcase you are the 15th Ryoshi-copycat? Where has all the goddamn fun and creativity gone?

                        You are a community member who has an offensive, creative or stupid marketing idea? Send a proposal to the DAO and get funds to execute it after a vote of <span className="font-semibold">$KEK</span> holders.
